## What is TextSniper?

**TextSniper** is a lightweight, precision **OCR utility** that grabs text from your screen and converts it into editable content instantly. It’s ideal when you need to extract quotes from images, copy text from slides, capture code from screenshots, or digitize printed material without retyping. The tool runs in the menu bar and captures selected regions with a quick hotkey — returning clean, selectable text ready to paste.

TextSniper recognizes multiple languages and preserves basic formatting where possible. It supports capturing text from PDFs, videos, web pages, presentations, and even from apps that block standard copy/paste. Advanced options include clipboard history integration, automatic language detection, and configurable capture shortcuts. Because it focuses on speed and simplicity, TextSniper is especially handy for researchers, students, journalists, and developers who frequently need ad-hoc text extraction.

Designed to be unobtrusive, TextSniper uses minimal resources and works reliably on modern Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. Its straightforward workflow—select, capture, paste—reduces friction and turns any screen into editable text in seconds.
